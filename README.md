[Sustain](https://sustain.nordquists.com) is a ingredient label scanner for detecting unsustainable ingredients. 

Sustain is designed to make shopping sustainably easier. It allows you to easily scan an ingredient label for thousands of potentially unsustainble ingredients in real-time, with instant feedback. Sustain is written in **Swift with a backend (not shown here) in Python**. 

**Note: This demo project is not the Sustain project. This is a pared-down demonstration of some of Sustain's features with a limited dictionary. The full dictionary will be released on release of the application**

**Sustain is a closed-source project.**

## Technologies Used
I used Swift exclusively for the iOS application. I used Figma to design the application.
